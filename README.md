# Project_X

This project aims to create and optimize a stable diffusion
model that can use textual cues to convert pre-disaster
satellite photos into realistic post-disaster scenarios. This
work takes a unique approach by combining the latest diffusion
models with a customized dataset that includes satellite
photos taken before and after the tragedy together with
text prompts that provide explanations. The model shows
a significant capability in producing high-fidelity and accurate
post-disaster representations from pre-disaster photos
through painstaking fine-tuning and optimization. The
model’s remarkable precision and detail in adapting to different
disaster situations is one of the key discoveries, indicating
its potential utility as a tool for disaster management
and response preparation. The work’s ramifications include
improving catastrophe preparedness prediction skills, offering
vital information to emergency response teams, and supporting
efficient resource allocation at important moments.
This work paves the way for future advancements in AIassisted
predictive modeling for a range of practical uses,
in addition to advancing image transformation through AI
in the context of crisis management.
